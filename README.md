# Days :
### Day 1 : Time and Space Complexity ðŸ˜„

### Day 2 : Recursion ðŸ™„
  ##### Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a smaller part of the same problem. It's like solving a big puzzle by breaking it into smaller, similar pieces and solving each one step-by-step.

#### **Key Parts of Recursion:** 
- Base Case: The simple case that stops the function from calling itself more. It prevents an endless loop.
- Recursive Case: The part where the function calls itself with a smaller or simpler input
